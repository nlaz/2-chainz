It's Young Khalifa man
2 Chainz!

Money's the motivation,
Money's the conversation,
You on vacation, we gettin' paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eye closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You use plastic, we 'bout cash,
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!

I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me, now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, Ima go for it,
This moment, we own it
A I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

And the same ones that I ride with, be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with, if you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crowd with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
(ain't no way around it)
What you say? Tell me what you say
Working hard, repping for my dogs, do this everyday,
Taking off, looking out for all, making sure we ball,
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me, now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, Ima go for it,
This moment, we own it
A I'm not to be played with
(I ride or die for mine)
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
(I ride or die for love)
This moment, we own it

This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feeling like a killer inside
uh, financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Riding with the plugs so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sitting off set
I look better on your girl (than her outfit)

Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumping out on anybody who try to say something one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rose, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed,
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, Ima go for it,
This moment, we own it
A I'm not to be played with
(I ride or die for mine)
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
(I ride or die for love)
This moment, we own it

This moment, we own it
I ride or die for mine
I'm ride or die material
One life to live so here we go
This moment, we own it
